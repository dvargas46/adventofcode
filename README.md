My solutions for the Advent of Code events

There is a folder for each year that I have at least one solution in.
Feel free to run whichever day using the appropriate language as specified in the details below.

```js
[
    "Year 2019": {
        languages: "JavaScript (ES6) using NodeJS",
        participated: false,
        completed: false,
    },
    "Year 2020": {
        languages: "JavaScript (ES6) using NodeJS",
        participated: true,
        completed: true,
    }
]
```

## TODO
- Create a README within each year for any specific details during the year (e.g. afterthoughts, execution instructions, etc)
- Make it easier to run any specific day (maybe npm scripts or a small node app?)
